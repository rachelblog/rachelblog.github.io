								<p class="animate-box">Is it still possible to show Pablo Picasso through a fresh lens? Can an artist be explored in relation to paper? A material which is central to all artistic production, can it provide new insights into Picasso’s work? </p>
								<p class="animate-box">Picasso and Paper explores the longstanding relationship between Picasso and his primary material Paper. In order to understand Picasso’s love of paper it is essential to go back to the start of his career. Picasso dedicated his life to producing art, desperate to be creative, he would use anything he could get his hands on. His initiative and experimentation as an artist was unparalleled during the first half of the Twentieth Century.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">Picasso and Paper celebrates Picasso’s innovation, by exploring his various artistic styles throughout his career. The exhibition also celebrates Picasso’s knowledge and consistent reflection of the history of art. This exhibition references Picasso’s study of Eugéne Delacroix’s Femmes d’Alger dans leur appartement, 1934 and Edouard Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe, 1963.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">Exploring Picasso’s work through the medium of paper is a refreshing new angle and interesting take. It also gives the Royal Academy an opportunity to exhibit many Picasso doodles, letters, paper cut-outs which would not usually be exhibited.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">Picasso and Paper has quite a strong biographical focus, typical for exhibitions centred around the work of Picasso. With many artists it is possible for their private life to remain private, but this is not possible with Picasso. His professional career as an artist and personal life are intertwined. Picasso’s work is deeply personal, as he consistently brings his personal life to light in his work, with his muses featuring in many of his works.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">In 1900 Picasso travelled to Paris for the first time, where he was exposed to a range of influential artists including Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh. In 1901 Picasso’s close friend Carles Casagemas committed suicide which led to the development of his Blue Period. Blue expressed the melancholy of his subjects, the poverty and loneliness of people struggling to survive on the margins of society. La Vie is seen as a high point of Picasso’s Blue Period through his use of colour, enigmatic symbolic allegory and overall sense of isolation. </p>

								<p class="animate-box">Paper had a central role in the development of Cubism, a revolutionary method of constructing pictorial space. Picasso’s exploration of collage marked a turning point in the history of art. Violin is an example of an early papiers collés, his inventiveness is evident through his experimentation with materials, incorporating paper cut-outs, decorative wallpaper and newspaper.</p>
								<!--<p class="animate-box"><img src="images/krasner.png"></div></p>-->
								<p class="animate-box">Picasso’s experimentation with collage continued. Femmes á leur toilette shows Picasso’s innovation with paper as a medium. He constructed this collage using a large stockpile of decorative papers found in wallpaper shops. Picasso depicts the three central women in his life. On the left Olga Khokhlova, Picasso’s wife is represented. In the centre Dora Maar is depicted, whom Picasso was in an intimate relationship with. On the right Marie-Thérése Walter is shown holding a portrait of the artist. Picasso took up a secret relationship with Marie-Thérése Walter in January 1927 and the couple shared a daughter, Maya. The three women appear distressed in this work. </p>
								
								<p class="animate-box">Picasso’s Seated Woman is a portrait of Dora Maar, who Picasso was intimately involved with since 1935. Maar played an important role in documenting Picasso’s Guernica. This painting was a commission for the Republic’s pavilion at the Paris World’s Fair of 1937. The subject of the work was the aerial bombing of the Basque city of Guernica on 26 April 1937, when hundreds of innocent civilians perished. Maar photographed the painting through its various stages of development. Picasso painted many portraits of Maar, most famously The Weeping Woman, where Maar is represented as a tortured, anguished woman. Maar was an artist in her own right, and had an great impact on Picasso’s work during their relationship.</p>
								<p class="animate-box"></p>
								
								<p class="animate-box">Picasso was one of the most innovative artists of the Twentieth Century, Picasso had the deepest admiration for the ‘great masters’. From 1954 to 1961 he studied the well-known masterpieces, Eugéne Delacroix’s Femmes d’Alger dans leur appartement, 1934 and Edouard Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe, 1963. Picasso did not just copy these works, rather he took inspiration from them, deconstructing their symbolism and reconstructing through a wide range of techniques.</p>
