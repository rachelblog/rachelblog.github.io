								<p>Dublin has always been known for its architecture, particularly as a Georgian city. One building which particularly captures the essence of Dublin is a small local kiosk which stands at the junction of Leeson Street and Adelaide Road. The kiosk was designed in 1929 by the architect Michael Moynihan, (b. 1874) and built for the Dublin Corporation in 1930 by the builder J. P. Price. The building was to house a water pressure station, ladies’ lavatory, kiosk and telephone booth.</p> 
								<p>The kiosk was built in the Art Deco style, a newly established style of architecture which was an outcome of L’Exposition des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Moderne, held in Paris in 1925. It was one of the first international exhibitions to be dominated by a new modern architecture. In the late 1920’s and early 1930’s the Art Deco style became noticeably popular in Dublin. After the war of Independence, Ireland was trying to break away from Britain, who it had always looked to for artistic inspiration. Ireland now had to look elsewhere, and Paris was the obvious choice, thus Art Deco emerged as a National style of the time.</p> 
								<p>The Kiosk is symmetric in plan. Dolphin’s Barn bricks are used throughout the building to draw the viewers eyes towards certain details such as the bricks turned towards the circular window opening on its façade, creating an impactful doorway. The brickwork also gives the building classical elements. Below the cornice and unadorned frieze, the bricks are turned on their side which is reminiscent of an architrave adorned with metopes and triglyphs. By including these subtle, classical elements this references the past and Dublin’s traditionally classical refined style. Beneath the windows are herringbone panels of brickwork, adding character to the building. The Dublin coat of arms, shown on either side of the building, presents the building as distinctly of Dublin.</p> 
								<p>The Kiosk was to be built to comply with British standards, and it is important to note that Ireland was not completely independent from Britain yet. The Art Deco style can be viewed as quite reserved and perhaps not that radical, hence it is the underlying political context which makes this architecture radical in Dublin rather than the style itself. It is evident that the Art Deco style was adopted by Irish architects as a break away from British architecture and used as a nationalist style of its time.</p>
								<p>The Ordnance Survey maps published in 1893 (fig 1) show there was an existing waterworks building on site and the kiosk of 1929 was built to incorporate this. In 2003, as the building was no longer being used in its original function instead as a café, bricks were removed and windows were created on the side of the building, clearly absent in the earlier 1987 photographs. Previously three small windows existed with an area of herringbone design brickwork underneath each window (fig 3), although the herringbone design brickwork was later removed and replaced with glass (fig 4). The original windows reveal the exact location of the ladies’ lavatory within the building through their style.</p> 
								<p>On the façade, a large circular window occupies a substantial proportion of the front elevation, on top of which the building is labelled ‘KIOSK’ in bronze lettering. Previously this circular window framed the doorway, which was changed in 2003. The back section of the building housed the water pressure Station, locating this in an area of the building with a private, more formal entrance, away from the rest of the building’s functions, (fig 7). It can only be speculated that the telephone box was located at the front with the kiosk as it would not make sense for this to be located with the water pressure station with a private entrance at the back of the building.</p>
								<p>When you consider the Leeson Street kiosk in relation to its Dublin and historical context, it is a building which brilliantly characterises Dublin. As it stands at the junction of Leeson Street and Adelaide Road it represents a complex moment in Irish architectural history, as Dublin was seeking a new architectural style which could represent our Irish identity in a nationalist way. The Art Deco style played a major role representing the early free state. The kiosk served the people of the Leeson Street area, representing the local aspect of Dublin, as a meeting place for neighbours and fellow Dubliners, as well as commuters. Its function changed over time, currently serving as a café. The kiosk has a complex history similarly to the city of Dublin. One can only imagine the excitement when it was erected, standing on one of the major routes into the city, with its unique appearance and diverse function, stamped with the Dublin coat of arms, it is magnificently Dublin.</p>
