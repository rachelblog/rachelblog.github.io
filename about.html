								<p class="animate-box">My name is Rachel Owens and I am an Irish Art Historian based in London. I have always had a great passion for the arts. From a young age I wanted to be an artist, I spent all my time drawing, painting and making things. I found it necessary to be creative in order to express myself.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">I first found my passion for Art History while studying Art at school. I had an amazing teacher who made it my favourite subject, a class I looked forward to everyday. While studying Impressionism I fell in love with the Art History and became fascinated with the impressionists use of colour, painting en plein air, the beauty and purity of these works mixed with the controversial reactions they provoked.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">I studied a joint BA in Art History and Irish Language at University College Dublin. I went on to complete an MA in Art History at UCD, which was an incredible experience. The MA I completed was research focused which suited me well, and I focused on Irish Conceptual Art, writing my thesis on the 1972 Irish Exhibition of Living Art. This exhibition is an extremely important exhibition in the history of Irish Conceptual art, yet remains relatively overshadowed due to ROSC, a series of international exhibitions held in Dublin between 1967 and 1988. The 1972 IELA marks the introduction of Sound art in Ireland with James Coleman’s Stereopiece, the first Performance piece seen in Ireland with Brian O’Doherty’s Name Change and first Video art piece with Les Levine’s The Troubles: An Artist’s Document of Ulster. This exhibition gave Irish artists an opportunity to respond to Conceptual art in an Irish context.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">During my MA I discovered the Irish Georgian Society who had recently restored the City Assembly House in Dublin and were hosting an exhibition, Exhibiting Art in Georgian Ireland. I started volunteering with the society, invigilating the exhibition and developed a great interest for the work the society carried out and decided to pursue an internship, updating the IGS’s Catalogue of Theses and Dissertations Relating to Architecture and the Allied Arts, a research and cataloguing task. I also had the opportunity to assist at the Great Georgian lecture series, developing a strong interest in Irish Georgian architecture.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">I decided to move to London and moved in March 2019. I am interested in Modern and Contemporary art and felt that I would get better exposure by living in London. It was very scary moving to London alone and especially going over with no job but I had a lot of support from family and friends and even my lecturers from university. I got really lucky and managed to get a job within a week of arrival, working at The British Museum in a front of house role. Through this position I met so many amazing individuals who were starting out in their careers and shared my passion for the arts. Working at The British Museum meant I had free access to all exhibitions across London, so I got to see everything!</p>
								<p class="animate-box">I was keen to stay involved with the Irish Georgian Society after moving to London, and joined the board of the London chapter of the Irish Georgian Society. I organised and gave a tour of The British Museum’s Enlightenment Gallery for members of the Irish Georgian Society October 2019 which was an extremely successful event and enjoyed by all.</p>
								<p class="animate-box">I recently started working as a gallery assistant at Jealous Gallery, a contemporary print gallery based in London. My position is extremely varied ranging from curating and hanging exhibitions, to managing the gallery’s social media account to working at art fairs dealing with buyers. It is really good experience!</p>
								<p class="animate-box">I created this website to bring together my research, to act as a platform where I can share exhibition reviews, personal projects and publications. I love to research and write about art and would love to be able to share this with those who would enjoy reading it. Please reach out to me if you have any feedback about my writings. </p>
								<p class="animate-box">I hope you enjoy!</p>
